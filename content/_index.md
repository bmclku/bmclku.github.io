      # title: About
      text: |
        Our team endeavors to uncover the complex computational dynamics underlying <span style="color: #a52a2a; font-weight:bold;">visual cognition in both humans and machines</span>. This pursuit involves delving into the computational principles and neural mechanisms within the brain that enable stable visual representations of our environment. In parallel, we leverage understanding from human cognition to advance machine models. As machines become integral to our daily lives and play a crucial role in society, the demand for trustworthy, human-compatible machine models cannot be overstated. We envision a future where machines and humans work together seamlessly, with technology augmenting human tasks and activities. If our vision aligns with your academic or professional pursuits, feel free to <b>[contact](contact)</b> the PI to discuss collaboration opportunities or to learn more about becoming a member of our team.

        Our current research focus areas:
        - Examining the robust nature of human object and face recognition
        - Developing bio-inspired strategies for deep learning
        - Exploring the mysteries behind visual illusions
        - Understanding high-level semantic cognition 
        - Decoding human brain activity for insights into the mind
