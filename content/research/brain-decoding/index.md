Brain decoding techniques offer an unprecedented window into our underlying cognitive states, perceptions, and intentions. These techniques enable researchers to access and interpret an individual's mental processes without relying on subjective self-reports, thus often referred to as "mind reading."

The process involves decoding and reconstructing cognitive information from patterns of brain activity recorded through neuroimaging methods such as fMRI, EEG, MEG, or single-neuron recordings. Various types of decoders have been proposed determining not only low-level perceptual features, such as the orientation an individual is perceiving, but also complex stimuli like objects, scenes, or even continuous streams of dynamic visual information, such as movies. Moreover, recent advancements in AI have led to the development of AI-based decoders that can translate brain activity into a continuous stream of text or predict visual semantic contents with remarkably high accuracy.

While the potential applications of brain decoding are vast, it is equally important to understand and address the current limitations of this technology, as well as the potential for misuse or unintended consequences. Nevertheless, brain decoding techniques hold immense promise for various practical applications, including the development of advanced brain-computer interfaces and assistive technologies for individuals with disabilities.

Moreover, this reverse engineering approach provides a powerful tool for neuroscientists to better understand the intricate mechanisms of cognition in the brain. By decoding the neural representations of specific cognitive processes, researchers can gain insights into how the brain encodes, processes, and integrates information, leading to a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying perception, attention, and other complex cognitive functions.
