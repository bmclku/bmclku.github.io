A key characteristic of human visual perception is its robustness. Despite variations in the external environment, our internal visual representations remain stable and consistent. What mechanisms enable this robustness, and how can they be understood? Answering this question is also crucial for developing reliable machine vision systems.

Imagine a scenario where a person is driving under adverse weather conditions. The driver must navigate through traffic, avoid other vehicles, and be wary of pedestrians, all while contending with significant visual disruptions like heavy rain or snow. Alternatively, consider the situation of finding a friend in a crowded place. Despite the presence of numerous individuals, identifying a familiar face is not as challenging as it might seem. Humans possess an exceptional ability for robust object recognition, a core component of our visual perception, which facilitates seamless interaction with our surroundings despite obstacles such as variations in size and orientation, differences in lighting, or even partial obstructions. 

For several decades, the field of vision science has endeavored to uncover the mechanisms behind the resilience of human vision. Currently, we have access to a variety of technical equipment to study brain behavior, alongside computational models designed to explore these phenomena. This exploration has gained urgency, particularly because, despite deep learning's impressive achievements in visual recognition tasks—sometimes claiming to reach or even surpass human levels of performance—these models frequently struggle in practical applications. Examples of these shortcomings include self-driving vehicles failing to adapt to novel scenarios, surveillance systems inaccurately identifying faces, and medical imaging technologies making erroneous assessments. 

Our research group is dedicated to leveraging diverse psychological methodologies, neuroimaging technologies, and deep learning models to decipher the secrets behind the robust nature of human vision. Notably, deep learning models offer a groundbreaking method to validate numerous hypotheses within neuroscience. Specifically, the comparative analysis between human and machine vision provides insights into how visual information is internally represented in both entities, presenting new perspectives on the essence of robustness in visual perception. We believe our research efforts will have profound implications for both neuroscience and the development of safer, more advanced AI technologies.
