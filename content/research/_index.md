        <font size=4>To explore cognition at the intersection of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and computer science through a multidisciplinary approach. Our interests include perception, recognition, reasoning, cognitive control, learning, memory, and social cognition, with the goal of uncovering their neural and computational mechanisms and bridging the gap between biological and artificial intelligence systems.</font>

        Our goal is to examine cognition at the intersection of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and computer science through an integrated methodological framework. We investigate areas such as perception, recognition, reasoning, cognitive control, learning, memory, and social cognition to clarify their neural and computational mechanisms and inform both biological and artificial intelligence.
