At the center of my academic journey has been a deep curiosity to puzzle out the intricate algorithms that underpin human visual perception and cognition. In this pursuit, I leverage a combination of behavioral and psychophysical experiments, neuroimaging techniques, and state-of-the-art computational modeling. Particularly, as we enter an era where AI systems become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, I see a compelling opportunity to investigate the fundamental principles of cognitive neuroscience through the lens of comparing human and machine cognition.

I should acknowledge that my academic progress has been greatly influenced by the guidance of [Prof. Jong-Hwan Lee](https://bspl-ku.github.io/), [Prof. Frank Tong](http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/tonglab/web/Home.html), [Dr. Xavier Boix](https://www.mit.edu/~xboix/), and [Prof. Pawan Sinha](https://www.sinhalab.mit.edu/). Their mentorship has not only enriched my understanding of engineering and neuroscience but has also set a solid foundation for my research. Those interested in their contributions to science are encouraged to visit their websites.

Our lab encourages an environment where making mistakes is part of the learning process, unique ideas are welcome, and a sense of commitment and curiosity is encouraged. We believe in creating a supportive and collaborative atmosphere that allows every member to grow and contribute in their own way.
