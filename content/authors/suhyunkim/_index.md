The reason why Iâ€™m studying AI while majoring in computer science is that I have expectations for the instrumental usability of artificial Intelligence. Cognitive processes based on the human brain have also been my long-standing concern. Recently, I have been academically curious about human cognition, especially when using machines. For humans to use artificial intelligence better, understanding each other is inevitable. As a result, I am expanding my understanding of boundaries by double majoring in psychology. 

I am deeply interested in studying people's cognitive processes using artificial intelligence. On the other hand, I am also interested in creating a better AI model through understanding human cognition. In the end, I want to contribute to the world where people can live, where humanity is not marginalized in the process of symbiosis with artificial intelligence. I am gaining experience in the Human-Machine Cognition Lab to get closer to my vision.
