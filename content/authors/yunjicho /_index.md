My interest in the field of computer science was ignited by the idea of artificial intelligence that not only emulates human cognition but also has the potential to surpass it. To pursue this ambition, I have chosen Computer Science as my primary major to develop the technical expertise necessary for AI development. I am also majoring in Brain and Cognitive Science as an interdisciplinary major to explore the intricate workings of the human brain. To further bridge these two areas, I joined the Brain and Machine Cognition Laboratory as a Research Intern to gain deeper insights and practical experience. 

My research focuses on modeling brain mechanisms using AI, with the aim of advancing AI technologies based on these models. My long-term goal is to make meaningful contributions to the field of neuroscience and to support the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-a future where AI possesses the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. Through this interdisciplinary approach, I hope to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve and advance our understanding of both artificial and human intelligence.
